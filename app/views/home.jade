        Angular Material Kitchen Sink is a starting point for building Angular
        Material web app.  It has everything that Angular Material has to
        offer.  All you have to do is modify the code to your own and remove
        stuff you don't want.  Much of the code comes from <a
        href="https://material.angularjs.org/latest">Angular Material docs</a>
        code snippets.

        HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we
        try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications.
        AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application.
        The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable,
        and quick to develop.
      p.text-primary.
        Other frameworks deal with HTML's shortcomings by either abstracting
        away HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way
        for manipulating the DOM.  Neither of these address the root problem
        that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.
      p.text-primary.
        AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your
        application development.  It is fully extensible and works well with
        other libraries.  Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit
        your unique development workflow and feature needs.  Read on to find
        out how.

      h3 Material is the metaphor
      p.text-primary.
        A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and
        a system of motion.  The material is grounded in tactile reality,
        inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet technoligically
        advanced and open to imagination and magic.
      p.text-primary.
        Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are
        grounded in reality.  The use of familiar tactile attributes helps
        users quickly understand affordances.  Yet the flexibility of the
        material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical
        world, without breaking the rules of physics.
      p.text-primary.
        The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying
        how objects move, interact, and exist in space and in relation to each
        other.  Realistic lighting shows seams, divides space, and indicates
        moving parts.

      h3 Bold, graphic, intentional
      p.text-primary.
        The foundational elements of print-based design-typography, grids,
        space, scale, color, and use of imagery-guide visual treatments.
        These elements do far more than please the eye.  They create hiearchy,
        meaning, and focus.  Deliberate color choices, edge-to-edge imagery,
        large-scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and
        graphic interface that immerser the user in the experience.
      p.text-primary.
        An emphasis on user actions make core functionality immediately
        apparent and provides waypoints for the user.

      h3 Motion provides meaning
      p.text-primary.
        Motion respect and reinforces the user as the prime mover.  Primary
        user actions are inflection points that initiate motion, transforming
        the whole design.
      p.text-primary.
        All action takes place in a single environment.  Objects are presented
        to the user without breaking the continuity of experience even as they
        transform and reorganize.
      p.text-primary.
        Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and
        maintain continuity.  Feedback is subtle yet clear.  Transition are
        efficient yet coherent.
